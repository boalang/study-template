Here is an overview of the folders layout.  The root contains scripts for
generating tables/figures for the paper, a `Makefile` for running scripts, and
a `README.md` file.

### Subdir: boa
These are the Boa queries used to generate data for the paper.

### Subdir: data
This is the output of the Boa queries (the `.txt`) files, as well as processed
versions of that output (`.csv` and `.parquet`).

### Subdir: figures
Any generated figures (`.pdf`) will go into this folder.

### Subdir: tables
Any generated tables (`.tex`) will go into this folder.
