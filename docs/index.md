# The Boa Study Template

Boa is a domain-specific language and infrastructure that eases mining software repositories. Boa's infrastructure leverages distributed computing techniques to execute queries against hundreds of thousands of software projects very efficiently.

Boa's Study Template was designed to aid researchers who want to use Boa in a research study.  The goal was two-fold: first, to make it easier to write, run, and process Boa queries and outputs and second, to enable better replicability in research.
